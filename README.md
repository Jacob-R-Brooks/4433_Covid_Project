# 4433_Covid_Project

Dataset comes from https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Provisional-COVID-19-Death-Counts-by-Week-Ending-D/r8kw-7aab/data_preview

The purpose of the project is to visualize covid-19 deaths in the US
A User can select the states, start and end dates, and weekly deaths or cumulative deaths from covid-19
The first graph will generate a line plot for each state selected with X = time and Y = to either weekly or cumulative deaths
The second graph will show the US and indicate the weekly or cumulative deaths by week. Users can adjust the date viewed.

Please note that the second graph can take a long time to load completely
